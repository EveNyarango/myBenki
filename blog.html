            <p>Below are ways which will come in handy during rainy days financially speaking.
                <br> This is how you come up with the rainy day funds to help you out of your troubles.

                    <p class="card-text">You should aim to have enough in your emergency fund to support
                        yourself for three to six months with no income–if you assume the worst, you’ll be
                        prepared for anything. Take a look at your monthly expenses and come up with a rough
                        estimate of how much you spend each month, then multiply that figure by anything between
                        three and six, and make that the amount you hope to have in your emergency fund.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">If you’re setting aside money for an emergency, you should make sure
                        that your rainy day funds go into an account that you’re not reaching into every day.
                        That way, you’ll know how much, exactly, you’ve already set aside, and you’ll protect
                        yourself from the temptation of using your savings for frivolous expenses. A
                        high-interest savings account is probably your best option: your stash can mature as
                        long as you’re not touching it, but it will still be easily accessible when it becomes
                        necessary.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">There are many creative ways to set money aside for your emergency
                        fund. First, by devoting a certain portion of your monthly budget to your savings, you
                        can set your sights on a specific date by which you’ll have enough money to rest easy.
                        Other ideas, like keeping a jar in your house for small bills that will eventually be
                        put into your emergency fund, can go a long way towards building savings quickly.</p>
